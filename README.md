# ICH Code Club Meeting 08.04.20
Sam Neal answers the question "What's a JSON file?"

## Abstract

In this short talk, Sam will provide a brief introduction to his research and why he came to learn about JSON files, 
followed by an overview of the JSON format for storing data. A worked example using Nobel laureate data will help to 
demonstrate using JSON in R.
